- 👋 Hi, I’m @guillermaus92, a Spanish electronics engineer currently working in Abu Dhabi as an Android Developer (previously also worked as an iOS Developer).
- 👀 I’m interested in many things. I consider myself a person with many hobbies. I love listening to music and reading, but the thing I enjoy the most is exercising. I love badminton, football (soccer), taekwondo, tennis, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some Java and going on improving my abilities in Kotlin and also in Swift.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Kotlin projects to improve my knowledge and help the community have better libraries available.
